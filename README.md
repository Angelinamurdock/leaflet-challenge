## Overview
A interactive project exploring the visualization of earthquake data from the *United States Geological Survey*, or *USGS* using **JavaScript** and **Leaflet**. This map allows users to visualize all earthquakes that have happened in the last 30 days overlayed on different map layers. The data is displayed using markers that reflect the magnitude and depth of each earthquake.

## Methodology
### Data Processing and Visualization
**JavaScript Functions**: The app relies on JavaScript functions to retreive the earthquake geoJSON data and return this data in a specific way to create dynamic visualizations.

**Leaflet**: The app uses Leaflet to create an interactive map. Leaflet allows users to interact with the data points, allowing them to get information on the magnitude, location and depth of each earthquake.
